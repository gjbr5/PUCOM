                <p>Your About Us page is vital. It’s often the first stop in any user’s journey through a website or blog.</p>
                <p>It also shouldn’t be their last, because first impressions count online just as much as they do in the real world.
                    If your visitors aren’t impressed, you can expect them to leave without reading your awesome content or completing a conversion action (e.g., signing up for your newsletter, making a purchase).</p>

                <p>A Privacy Policy is a legal statement that specifies what the business owner does with the personal
                    data collected from users, along with how the data is processed and for what purposes.</p>

                    to be developed to protect personal data.</p>
                <p>This marks the start of what we know now as a “Privacy Policy.” While the name “Privacy Policy”
                    refers to the legal agreement, the concept of privacy and protecting user data is closely
                    related.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>A Privacy Policy can be used for both your website and mobile app if it’s adapted to include the platforms your business operates on.</p>
                <p>The requirements for Privacy Policies may differ from one country to another depending on the legislation. However, most privacy laws identify the following critical points that a business must comply with when dealing with personal data</p>
